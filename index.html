        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Nicholas Chan. I am from San Jose, CA, and have lived there all my life prior to attending college. I am a first year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently majoring in Pre-Business, with the goal of concentrating in Information Systems in the future. I am ea	ger to gain more professional experience through any opportunities whether it be internships, jobs, clubs, or volunteering in order to learn more about the business field and working with other people. I would like to get started as soon as possible, preferably during this upcoming summer or after my second year. In the past, I was involved in a variety of activities which helped me to develop my skills including clubs, work, and sports. These activities include an investment club, teaching swimming, lifeguarding, and playing water polo. Many of my activities revolve around the pool, as I have found a great passion being in the aquatic environment. Some hobbies I enjoy doing outside of work and school are playing basketball, going to food places, and binge watching TV shows.<br><br>

        Currently, I do not have a lot of professional experience as it is still early in my college career, but I definitely am looking to gain more. I have had a summer job working at Rancho Rinconada, a local pool in my hometown, since my freshman year of high school. I was able to gain leadership and other soft skills during my time there. I was given the position of Senior Lifeguard, having the responsibility of managing other lifeguards on duty. I also had to teach skills to new employees and lead trainings. I also learned some other general but still very useful skills from having to interact with patrons of all ages. I mainly taught young children during the swim lessons, but I also had to figure out how to teach adults which required a different technique. Getting the certification for lifeguarding was a long, tedious process, but it was definitely worth it. Having knowledge of CPR, AED, and other life saving skills is not only extremely rewarding, but is also very useful to have in case of emergency.<br><br>

        Outside of work, I tried to gain as much experience as I could in the field by doing business related activities. I think that the volatility of the stock market is something that is very interesting to analyze, so I decided to join the investment club at my high school. I spent a lot of time in the club, learning a lot about stocks, the economy, and business in general. I ran simulations of the market, analyzing and studying changes and trends of various companies and assets. I learned how to work with others collaboratively in order to make a decision that was best for the group. During an event that I attended, I competed against other schools with my peers in the club. I developed an investment plan that our group eventually implemented and led to great success in the competition.
